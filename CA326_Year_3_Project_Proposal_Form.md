## Project Description: 

The AI-powered Finance Coach will be an educational mobile app designed to help students or any adult, to improve their financial habits and financial literacy through budgeting tools, interactive lessons and AI-generated explanations. 

Many people struggle with managing their finances, by not keeping track of their expenses or not organising their portfolio effectively. Financial education is often inaccessible, unengaging and overly complex to most people. This project aims to address this issue by the combination of artificial intelligence and technology-enhanced learning to create an interactive, data-driven learning platform with focus on budgeting, saving and smart spending. 

The application will also provide short and engaging lessons and modules on financial terminologies and markets basics. Each lesson will be based on users' previous answers to have a unique and optimised learning experience, with visual progress tracking to keep the user motivated.

The systems key feature is an AI tutor, which responds to users queries about their spending habits or goals, and will also recommending lessons based on individual learning progress. The AI tutor will also deliver explanations regarding financial terms, stock/crypto market insights. 

The expected outcome is a secure, engaging and user-friendly mobile application  which educates the users to make informed financial decisions, be more intentional with their budgeting and spending habits, keep track of their financial goals and give the user an introduction and fundamentals to the stock/crypto market for future investments. 

## **Division of Work**

**Anthony Kalu** **-** Front End Development – Flutter, Mobile Application Design, Templates. Setting up the interactive learning part of the App. 

**Aaron O’Shea** **–** Back End Development – Django Implementation, database models, API integration, user authentication. Integration of AI 

 

## **Programming Languages** 

- **Dart** *–* For Front End Mobile App Development with Flutter. Good for building fast, cross-platform apps. We chose to use Flutter instead of React as we felt the UI fits our app better. It also gives us the opportunity to learn a new, increasingly popular coding language. 

- **Python** **–** For Back End Development with Django framework. We chose to use Python and Django due to its efficiency and our prior experience. Django’s built in user authentication and Rest API support will be important for our project. 

- **SQL** **–** For managing relational data like user profiles, transactions, budgets etc. The use of SQL will handle the storage of data and its retrieval efficiently. 

 

## **Programming Tools** 

- **Dart Compiler/Dev Tools**: To write, compile and debug the code. 

- **Flutter SDK:** For developing the mobile app. 

- **(IDE’s) Integrated Development Environments**: We will use Visual Studio Code. 

- **Django Framework:** For backend API dev., handling of data and user authentication. 

- **SQL Database:** SQLite to handle storage and retrieval of data. 
- **GitHub:** Managing source code and teamwork. 
- **CI/CD Tools**: For automation for mobile app. 

 

## **Main Learning Challenges** 

 

#### **New Programming Language – Dart** 

With Dart being a relatively new programming language, this will be our first experience using it. Dart is a modern, object-oriented language designed for the development of fast, efficient Flutter based mobile apps. We will have to learn Dart’s syntax and programming concepts. Although this is a definite learning curve for us, Dart’s similarities to languages such as Java/JavaScript makes it approachable. We believe learning Dart is beneficial as it will help broaden our skills in cross-platform app development benefiting future projects/career opportunities. 

 

#### **Flutter Framework** 

We will need to learn Flutter’s widget system and app state management. We will also need to learn how to handle asynchronous data and API calls. We imagine this will be difficult at first, but Flutter’s comprehensive documentation and active community support should help us along the way. 

 

#### **AI Integration** 

The incorporation of AI API’s will also be another challenge we will face. Although difficult, learning this skill will greatly enhance the interactive aspect of our application. This incorporation includes managing secure connections, real-time responses and performance optimization. We believe AI Integration will greatly enhance the quality of our app
